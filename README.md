PAC-meter : Political Alignment Checker meter


# what it does
It takes in the url of the current webpage that you are on, then it finds the author and the amount of political buzzwords on the page.
Once it has found the buzzwords on the page, the extention will try to get the context for the word. Once it has the context the extetnion 
will score the buzz words as either liberal (+1) or conservative (-1).
Then it generates a score by taking the ( score / total buzz words ) * 100
